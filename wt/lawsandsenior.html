      <h2>Laws and Senior Citizen</h2>
      <p>
        Once an individual reaches the age of 60, they are designated as "Senior
        Citizens." Being labeled as a senior citizen implies that specific laws
        have been put in place for their benefit and protection. Unfortunately,
        many older adults are unaware of these regulations. In this article, we
        aim to provide insights into laws that are advantageous to the elderly.
        Recognizing the significant negligence faced by older adults, the
        government introduced the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior
        Citizen Act in 2007. The following are key provisions outlined in this
        act:
      </p>

    <div class="para-box">
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        This law is designed to ensure the safety and security of senior
        citizens, shielding them from potential harm caused by individuals or
        circumstances. In the event of any trouble faced by senior citizens due
        to another individual, they have the right to file a complaint directly
        with the District Magistrate's (DM) office or the nearest police
        station. A dedicated helpline number, 1291, has been established for
        senior citizens to register their complaints. As per this law, a senior
        citizen must file a complaint within 24 hours of the incident, and the
        DM is required to resolve the case within 30 days from the date of
        filing the complaint.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="para-box">
      <h2>Care</h2>
      <p>
        Care: If a senior citizen is living with their family or independently
        and is unable to sustain themselves, the law permits them to request
        their children or close relatives to provide them with Rs 10,000 per
        month for their livelihood. In case the legal heir of the senior citizen
        refuses to provide subsistence, they will be liable to pay a fine of Rs
        5000 or face a jail term of up to three months, or both.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="para-box">
      <h2>Property</h2>
      <p>
        Senior citizens who own property cannot be compelled to vacate their
        premises. If such coercion occurs, they have the right to file a case
        against the perpetrators at the DM office. They are authorized to
        designate a legal heir for their property based on the care they
        receive. If any fraudulent activity is detected after the property has
        been willed to someone, the senior citizen can file a complaint against
        the individual.Property: Senior citizens who own property cannot be

      <h2>Free Legal Assistance</h2>
      <p>
        Senior citizens with an annual income of less than two lakhs are
        entitled to receive free legal assistance for any court-related matters.
