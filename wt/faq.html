Some amount of stretching exercise can be done, or consult a physical trainer or yoga trainer. You can also do yoga, which helps in breathing and respiration, like pranayam. Spiro ball can also be used for breathing exercises; procedure to use is available online. But in case of acute asthma it has to be avoided. </p>
